# caritas-project
This repository contains all code written in R for project of CorrelAid and the German welfare association Caritas from 2021/2022. Aim of the project was to analyze data from Caritas' yearly survey of clients from the "Allgemeine Sozialberatung" (general social counseling). Clients come to the counseling for support in matters like debt, unemployment or issues with public authorities.
The preprocessed data was provided Caritas, but is not publically available and not part of this repository. The results of the analyses were summarized in the pdf report **Caritas_Markdown_Report.pdf** and in an article published by the "neue caritas" magazine. All project results are only available in German.

To see the code of the analyses, please have a look at the R-markdown file **skripte/Caritas_Markdown_Report.pdf** and all skripts starting with **skripte/Artikel...**. They partly link to other skripts via *source* function, which are also all available in this repository.
